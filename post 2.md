# I can't create an app

There is something wrong with mobincube.com that my app has an unfixable error about app is not publishing. Everyone who uses mobincube and a professional "file explorer", can y'all say what happened to my app? Because maybe i added unuseful files and not understanding what happened? The app is named "Mobistore by Злой Андрей 1 (I think) and it's not popular. If someone not in case, check the link mobincube.mobi and find mobistore here. If it is uploaded, means i am dumb and did not saw that.
